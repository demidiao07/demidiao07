## Hi, I’m Wenshu (Demi) Diao 👋

I’m a graduate student in **Machine Learning & Data Science** at **Northwestern University**, with interests in applied machine learning, data engineering, and retrieval-augmented systems.

I enjoy working on problems where data is **messy, evolving, or out of distribution**, and where model performance depends as much on system design and evaluation as on algorithms.

---

## 🔍 What I Work On
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and vector search
- Data engineering pipelines (SQL → Python → ML)
- Embeddings, similarity search, and evaluation
- Reproducible ML systems (Docker, environment isolation)
- Interpretable modeling and error analysis

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔹 AI Agents Jobs Ecosystem — RAG & Vector Search Pipeline
Built an end-to-end vector database and RAG system on post-2023 AI agent job data (2025–2026).  
Evaluated baseline LLMs against RAG, HyDE query rewriting, and LLM-based reranking to improve grounding and reduce hallucinations.

**Tech:** Python, LangChain, ChromaDB, OpenAI embeddings, HyDE, reranking

---

### 🎬 Predicting Movie Critic Ratings from Pre-Release Metadata
Developed and evaluated linear regression models to predict movie critic scores using only pre-release features such as genre, runtime, and MPAA rating.  
Demonstrated that genre explains substantially more variance than runtime-based features.

**Tech:** Python, SQL (PostgreSQL), pandas, EDA, regression modeling

---

### 🛳️ Reproducible Titanic Survival Modeling with Docker (Python & R)
Implemented parallel logistic regression pipelines in Python and R, each fully containerized with Docker.  
Demonstrates reproducible data loading, preprocessing, training, and inference across languages.

**Tech:** Docker, Python, R, logistic regression

---

## 🧠 Tools & Skills
- **Languages:** Python, R, SQL  
- **ML:** regression, classification, embeddings, RAG  
- **Data:** PostgreSQL, pandas, EDA  
- **Infra:** Docker, virtual environments  
- **LLMs:** OpenAI API, LangChain, ChromaDB

## 📌 What I Care About
I care about building ML systems that are **grounded in real data**, **evaluated rigorously**, and **reproducible**, rather than demo-only or benchmark-driven.
